# Namma Nagara - Real-Time Civic Intelligence Platform

## 🏙️ Overview
Namma Nagara is an AI-powered civic intelligence platform designed to tackle Bengaluru's data overload by synthesizing scattered civic reports (traffic, floods, protests, etc.) into actionable insights. This project was created for Google Cloud's Agentic AI Day by Team Lemillion to solve the problem of "Managing City Data Overload".

> *"Bengaluru has civic tech — but not civic intelligence. Citizens feel helpless; authorities feel overloaded."*
