## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#702963) to convey authority and importance, with a nod to the tech industry of the client's headquarters. The dark shade is good for dark mode and for accessibility against light-colored text.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#26232D), near black, providing excellent contrast for data visualization. It matches the primary purple in hue, but is far less saturated and much darker.
- Accent color: Violet (#B45E97) to highlight key metrics and interactive elements. It is near to the primary color on the color wheel, but much brighter, so it stands out.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, known for its clean readability and modern aesthetic.
- Use minimalist icons for alerts and actions, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding.
- Employ a card-based layout to organize data and ensure information is easily digestible for different screen sizes.
- Subtle animations for data updates and transitions to provide real-time feedback and engagement without being distracting.
